PHDays Badge is an interactive device made by Positive Labs for cybersecurity festival PHDays Fest. It can display images and animations on a 10x10 pixel screen. There is a set of some standard, but you can connect to it via Wi-Fi and draw your own image or animation. It also can play RTTTL melodies and has built-in RTTTL-editor.

WebUI is located in separate [PHDays-Badge-WebUI](https://github.com/nlef/PHDays-Badge-WebUI) repository.
